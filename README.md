## Introduction  

#### About This Project
fractal is a 42 Project that aims to draw the fractal

#### About Me
Developer, Designer Be creative!! Currently Studying [@42SiliconValley][42]

#### About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42] 

## Objective  
The assignment is broken up into a part 1 and part 2. Part 1 is to discover /use the mathematical notion of complex numbers. Part 2 is to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics.

## Instructions
Make sure you have the needed [dependencies](#dependencies) before proceeding.
For instructions and/or greater detail refer to the project [pdf][pdf]
## Mandatory
1. Implement at least 3 different types of fractals, including Julia st and the Mandelbrot set. The third fractal can be free to choose.
2. To make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse (without clicking). For other types of fractal, you can do what you want.
3. The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the computer). This is the very principle of fractals.
4. Use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. It's even better if you hack away on psychedelic effects.
5. A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits properly.
6. ESC will exit the program.
7. The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
## Bonus
1. The zoom follow the actual mouse position.
2. In addition to the zoom: moving with the arrows.
3. Make the color range shift.
4. Multi-threading implementation.
5. Plenty of fun fractals.
6. 3D representation.
7. Two valid parameters in the command line, resulting in two fractals in two windows.
8. You can add bonuses of your own invention, which will be assessed by your evaluators.

### Warning For 42 Students

This is not kept up to date and I cannot guarantee that it will work on your future machines. You are welcome to use and learn from this as you want, but do not implement code that you do not understand. Copying is not the way.
